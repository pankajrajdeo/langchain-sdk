# aedit

> **Method** in `deepagents`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/deepagents/backends/store/StoreBackend/aedit)

Async version of edit using native store async methods.

This avoids sync calls in async context by using `store.aget`/`aput` directly.

## Signature

```python
aedit(
    self,
    file_path: str,
    old_string: str,
    new_string: str,
    replace_all: bool = False,
) -> EditResult
```
