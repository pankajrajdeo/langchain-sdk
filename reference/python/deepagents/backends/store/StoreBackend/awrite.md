# awrite

> **Method** in `deepagents`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/deepagents/backends/store/StoreBackend/awrite)

Async version of write using native store async methods.

This avoids sync calls in async context by using `store.aget`/`aput` directly.

## Signature

```python
awrite(
    self,
    file_path: str,
    content: str,
) -> WriteResult
```
