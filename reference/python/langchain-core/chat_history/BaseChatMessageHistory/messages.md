# messages

> **Attribute** in `langchain_core`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-core/chat_history/BaseChatMessageHistory/messages)

A property or attribute that returns a list of messages.

In general, getting the messages may involve IO to the underlying persistence
layer, so this operation is expected to incur some latency.

## Signature

```python
messages: list[BaseMessage]
```
