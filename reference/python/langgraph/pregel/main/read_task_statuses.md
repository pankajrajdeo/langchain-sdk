# read_task_statuses

> **Function** in `langgraph`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/_task_status/read_task_statuses)

Return the status of every task that has recorded writes, keyed by task id.

Writes from `NULL_TASK_ID` are input to the superstep, not task activity, so
they are not included.

## Signature

```python
read_task_statuses(
    pending_writes: Iterable[PendingWrite],
) -> dict[str, TaskStatus]
```
