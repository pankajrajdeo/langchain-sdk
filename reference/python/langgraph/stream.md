Streaming infrastructure for LangGraph.

Compile a graph with `transformers=[...]` and call `graph.stream_events(version="v3")` /
`graph.astream_events(version="v3")` to drive a transformer pipeline that projects the
graph's raw events into ergonomic per-channel streams.

## Properties

- `SubgraphStatus`
