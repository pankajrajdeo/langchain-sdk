Discriminator field. Lets the channel reducer recognise an `Overwrite`
even after its dataclass form is JSON-serialised and the typed instance
is lost (e.g. an `orjson`-encoded state update routed through the
LangGraph API server).

## Signature

```python
type: Literal['__overwrite__'] = '__overwrite__'
```
