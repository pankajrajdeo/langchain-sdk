# abort

> **Method** in `langgraph`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/stream/run_stream/GraphRunStream/abort)

Stop the run early.

Closes the underlying graph iterator (propagating `GeneratorExit`
so in-flight nodes and subgraphs are cancelled), closes the mux,
and marks the stream exhausted. Idempotent.

## Signature

```python
abort(
    self,
) -> None
```
