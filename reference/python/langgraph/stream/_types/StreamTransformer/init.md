# init

> **Method** in `langgraph`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/stream/_types/StreamTransformer/init)

Return the projection dict.

Keys become entries in `run.extensions`. If the transformer has
`_native = True`, keys are also set as direct attributes on the
run stream.

StreamChannel instances in the return value are automatically
wired by the StreamMux for protocol event auto-forwarding.

## Signature

```python
init(
    self,
) -> dict[str, Any]
```
