# consume

> **Method** in `langgraph`

📖 [View in docs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/channels/base/BaseChannel/consume)

Notify the channel that a subscribed task ran.

By default, no-op.

A channel can use this method to modify its state, preventing the value from being consumed again.

Returns `True` if the channel was updated, `False` otherwise.

## Signature

```python
consume(
    self,
) -> bool
```
