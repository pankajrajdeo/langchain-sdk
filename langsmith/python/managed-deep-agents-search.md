# Built-in search powered by Parallel

> Add web search powered by Parallel to Managed Deep Agents without a separate account or API key.

[Managed Deep Agents](managed-deep-agents-overview.md) includes built-in web search powered by [Parallel](https://parallel.ai). Give your agent access to current information from the web to help answer questions.

LangSmith manages the search infrastructure, so you can add search without hosting a service or creating a separate Parallel account or API key. The integration offers zero data retention.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Built-in search is available only on LangSmith Plus and Startup plans. Usage is free during private beta.

## Before you begin

You need an existing [Managed Deep Agents project](managed-deep-agents-quickstart.md), your LangSmith workspace ID, and a personal LangSmith API key for use in Studio.

## Add Parallel search

To add Parallel search to your agent:

### Step 1. Set your workspace ID

In your project's `.env` file, set your LangSmith workspace ID:

**.env**

```shell
LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID=YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Step 2. Set your LangSmith API key

In the same `.env` file, set a personal LangSmith API key for use in Studio:

**.env**

```shell
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=YOUR_LANGSMITH_API_KEY
```

You do not need a Parallel API key.

### Step 3. Configure the search server

If the file already defines `mcp`, add `Parallel` to the existing `servers` map. Define `mcp` only once.

**Python**

Add `Parallel` to the `servers` map in `tools/mcp.py`.

**tools/mcp.py**

```python
from managed_deepagents import define_mcp

mcp = define_mcp(
    servers={
        "Parallel": {
            "transport": "http",
            "url": "https://api.smith.langchain.com/v1/managed-tools/servers/parallel/mcp",
        },
    },
)
```

**TypeScript**

Add `Parallel` to the `servers` map in `tools/mcp.ts`.

**tools/mcp.ts**

```typescript
import { defineMcp } from "managed-deepagents";

export const mcp = defineMcp({
  servers: {
    "Parallel": {
      transport: "http",
      url: "https://api.smith.langchain.com/v1/managed-tools/servers/parallel/mcp",
    },
  },
});
```

Your agent can now use Parallel search alongside its other tools.

## Terms of use

Your use of this integration must comply with Parallel's terms of service, including its restrictions on prohibited or abusive use.
