# Add skills to Managed Deep Agents
> Source: [Original LangChain documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/python/managed-deep-agents-skills)
Add reusable task-specific instructions to a Managed Deep Agent.

Skills package task-specific procedures and context into reusable directories. You can define them in markdown files, and they are picked up automatically by the agent.

> [!NOTE]
> Managed Deep Agents is in **public [beta](../release-stages.md)** and available on [LangSmith Cloud](../cloud.md) in the US region only.

## Project structure

Keep the agent entry point at the project root and define each skill under `skills/`:

```text
my-agent/
  agent.py
  skills/
    research/
      SKILL.md
```

## Add a skill

Each skill directory needs a `SKILL.md` file with `name` and `description` frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: research
description: Gather and synthesize context before answering complex questions.
---

# Research

Use this skill when a task needs more than a direct answer.

1. Identify what information is missing.
2. Use `query_db` to look up relevant records.
3. Summarize findings before responding to the user.
```

A skill directory can also contain supporting scripts, reference files, and templates. Reference these files from `SKILL.md` so the agent knows when to use them.

## How the agent uses skills

At startup, the agent sees each skill's `name` and `description`. When a task matches a skill's description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` and follows its instructions. Supporting files are loaded only when needed.

This progressive disclosure gives the agent access to detailed procedures without adding every skill's full contents to its context.

## Syncing to Context Hub

When you run `mda deploy`, every UTF-8 file under `skills/` is automatically synced to the agent's [Context Hub](../use-the-context-hub.md) repo. You can then edit skills in the LangSmith UI and make the changes available to the agent.

A later deployment syncs the project copies again and removes deployed skill files that no longer exist locally.

## How skills compare to other concepts

Skills is context that is loaded dynamically, when the agent chooses to. The agent cannot modify them.

Use [instructions](managed-deep-agents-instructions.md) for behavior that should ALWAYS be loaded by the agent.

Use [memory](managed-deep-agents-memory.md) for knowledge you want the agent to be able to update.

For skill authoring patterns and the complete format, see [Skills](../../deepagents/skills.md).
