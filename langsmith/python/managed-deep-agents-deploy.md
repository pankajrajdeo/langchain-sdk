# Deploy a Managed Deep Agent

> Test and deploy a Managed Deep Agent with the mda CLI.

Deploying a Managed Deep Agent compiles a code-first project into a managed LangGraph app, syncs deploy-owned context to [Context Hub](managed-deep-agents-context-hub.md), uploads the compiled source, and triggers a LangSmith hosted deployment build. The result is an [Agent Server](../agent-server-overview.md) deployment, including the Agent Server API and [MCP endpoint](managed-deep-agents-mcp-endpoint.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Managed Deep Agents is in **public [beta](../release-stages.md)** on [LangSmith Cloud](../cloud.md).

This page covers secrets routing and deploy options. To test the agent before deploying, see [Develop locally with LangSmith Studio](managed-deep-agents-local-development.md). For command flags, the deploy step list, and troubleshooting, see the [CLI reference](managed-deep-agents-cli.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy, make sure you have:

* A LangSmith Cloud workspace.

* A [LangSmith API key](../create-account-api-key.md) for that workspace, in `.env` or your shell environment. On an interactive terminal, `mda deploy` prompts for a key or signs you in through the browser instead.

* The `mda` CLI installed from `managed-deepagents`.

* Project dependencies installed with `uv sync` for generated Python projects.

* Model provider credentials, such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`, in `.env`, your shell environment, or LangSmith workspace secrets.

## Select a SaaS region

`LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` selects the LangSmith region the CLI deploys to. The CLI targets GCP US by default.

Set `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` in your project's `.env` or your shell environment before your first deploy:

| Region | Endpoint | Deployment support |
| - | - | - |
| GCP US (`smith.langchain.com`) | `https://api.smith.langchain.com` | Supported |
| GCP EU (`eu.smith.langchain.com`) | `https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com` | Supported |
| GCP APAC (`apac.smith.langchain.com`) | `https://apac.api.smith.langchain.com` | Supported |
| AWS US (`aws.smith.langchain.com`) | `https://aws.api.smith.langchain.com` | Supported |

For example, to deploy to GCP EU:

**.env**

```text
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://eu.api.smith.langchain.com
```

Credentials must belong to the target region. Set `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT` before the first deploy, because it also selects the region that browser sign-in authenticates against. A non-interactive run cannot fall back to browser sign-in, so in CI set `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` for the target region.

For more information on regions, see the [Regions FAQ](../regions-faq.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> LangSmith managed tools are available in GCP US only.

## Deploy to LangSmith

Deploy the local project:

```bash
uv run mda deploy
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `mda deploy` routes local project inputs to different managed surfaces:
>
```text
> instructions.md + skills/**  -> Context Hub deploy-owned context
> .env                         -> deploy auth + non-reserved hosted secrets, not archived
> project source files         -> .mda/build source archive -> hosted deployment
> schedules/**                 -> LangSmith cron jobs after the deployment is live
```

Set the deployment name explicitly when the directory name is not the name you want:

```bash
uv run mda deploy --name research-assistant
```

`mda deploy` creates a Serverless deployment by default. Use `--deployment-type dedicated` when creating a Dedicated deployment.

Serverless requires a supported GCP SaaS environment. AWS, Azure, self-hosted, and hybrid environments reject Serverless deployments. Use `dedicated` for always-on capacity.

```bash
uv run mda deploy --deployment-type dedicated
```

Use `--no-wait` to trigger the build without polling for completion:

```bash
uv run mda deploy --no-wait
```

When `--no-wait` is set, schedule reconciliation is skipped for that deploy invocation because the CLI exits before the deployment reaches `DEPLOYED`.

On success, the CLI prints the LangSmith deployment dashboard URL. For the full deploy step list, see the [CLI reference](managed-deep-agents-cli.md#deploy-projects).

## Set the Python version

> [!NOTE]
>
> Configuring the Python version requires `managed-deepagents>=0.8.0`.

MDA builds the deployment image on Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14, and by default selects the newest that `requires-python` allows. To pin a version, add the optional `[tool.mda]` table to `pyproject.toml`:

**pyproject.toml**

```toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.11"

[tool.mda]
python-version = "3.14"
```

When set, `python-version` takes a quoted `major.minor` string, with no patch version. MDA writes the resolved version to `python_version` in the generated `langgraph.json` and selects the matching [Agent Server](../agent-server-overview.md) image. `requires-python` remains the project's own compatibility requirement.

Pin it to stay on the same minor version when MDA adds support for a newer Python. To override it for a single build, set `MDA_PYTHON_VERSION`:

```bash
MDA_PYTHON_VERSION=3.12 uv run mda deploy
```

A target that `requires-python` excludes fails the build. One that depends on the image's exact patch version warns instead, because image tags do not pin patch versions.

`python-version` controls the deployment image only. Local builds, `mda dev`, Harbor task images, and [execution sandboxes](managed-deep-agents-sandboxes.md) select their interpreters separately.

## Secrets and environment files

`mda deploy` reads project `.env` values before shell environment variables. Use `.env` for the LangSmith API key that authenticates the deploy and for runtime secrets the hosted deployment needs:

**.env**

```text
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<LANGSMITH_API_KEY>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN=<GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN>
DATABASE_URL=<DATABASE_URL>
MDA_INGRESS_SECRET=<MDA_INGRESS_SECRET>
```

`MDA_INGRESS_SECRET` is required only when the project declares [backend identity](managed-deep-agents-identity.md#configure-identity-with-your-own-backend). Deploy fails preflight when that declaration is present and the value is missing.

`LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, `LANGGRAPH_HOST_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, and other platform variables are reserved. They can authenticate the deploy, but they are not uploaded as user-managed deployment secrets.

Non-reserved `.env` entries, such as model provider keys, MCP tokens, and custom tool credentials, are forwarded as hosted deployment secrets when `mda deploy` creates or updates the deployment. If the configured model requires a provider key, deploy fails before upload unless that key is available from `.env`, the shell environment, or LangSmith workspace secrets. When the provider key is only in the shell environment, `mda deploy` forwards it as a secret for that deploy.

Reserved platform variables, empty values, `.env`, and `.env.*` files are not copied into the compiled build archive.

For authentication key order and reserved variables, see the [CLI reference](managed-deep-agents-cli.md#authentication).

## Troubleshoot a deploy

For deploy troubleshooting, see the [CLI reference](managed-deep-agents-cli.md#troubleshooting).

If a deployment reaches `BUILD_FAILED` or `DEPLOY_FAILED`, open the printed deployment URL in LangSmith and inspect the revision logs.
